      <description>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women.</description>

      <description>Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions. In our case we will look at US data and use the FRED database to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the yield curve is and its inversion can be found here: https://fredblog.</description>

      <description>I was born in the United States in January 1999, more precisely in Livingston New Jersey. During my childhood I grew up between Paris (France) and Princeton (New Jersey). I am reading for the Masters in Financial Analysis degree at London Business School and wish to undertake a career in finance, and more specifically in either Global Capital Markets or in Global Advisory.
Thanks to my multicultural background I was, and still is, always interested in learning new approaches and adopting several points of view.</description>
